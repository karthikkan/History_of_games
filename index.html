    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Video games have helped me grow into the person I am today.  Through video games, I was able to truly appreciate the art of storytelling and worldbuilding.  Because of video games, I learned to communicate with others, whether they were teammates or classmates. 
 Video games inspired me to learn coding, helping me find the passion for it I have today.  This hackathon has finally given me a chance to pay homage to the thing that has helped me: our team created a website dedicated to the history of video games.  Please enjoy!
